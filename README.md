# Practice Project: Clean Code and SOLID Design Principles in C#

Welcome to the practice repository for Clean Code and SOLID design principles in C#! In this project, you will focus on learning and applying fundamental concepts of object-oriented programming and best practices for writing clean code in the context of the C# programming language.

## Project Objectives

The main goal of this repository is to enhance your C# programming skills through understanding and applying the following aspects:

1. **Clean Code**: We will learn to write clean and readable code, following the guidelines and recommendations of Robert C. Martin in his book "Clean Code." We will explore techniques and practices to enhance the quality and maintainability of our code.

2. **SOLID Design Principles**: We will delve into the five SOLID design principles proposed by Robert C. Martin for designing more maintainable, scalable, and flexible software. These principles are:
   - **S** - Single Responsibility Principle (SRP)
   - **O** - Open/Closed Principle (OCP)
   - **L** - Liskov Substitution Principle (LSP)
   - **I** - Interface Segregation Principle (ISP)
   - **D** - Dependency Inversion Principle (DIP)

## Repository Structure

The repository will be organized as follows:

- **`csharp/`**: This folder will contain the source files of our C# project. We will implement examples and exercises related to Clean Code and SOLID design principles here.
  
- **`csharp/Clean Code/`**: This folder will contain the exercises related to Clean Code.
  
- **`csharp/SOLID Design Principles/`**: Here you will find different project exercises to practice each of the SOLID design principles.

## Contributions

Contributions are welcome! If you'd like to participate in this project, you can follow these steps:

1. Clone this repository to your local.
2. Create a branch with a descriptive name for your contribution.
3. Make your changes and improvements in the branch.
4. Submit a pull request so that we can review your changes and merge them into the main project.

## Recommended Resources

Here are some resources that can help you understand and apply the concepts of Clean Code and SOLID Design Principles:

- Book: "Clean Code: A Handbook of Agile Software Craftsmanship" by Robert C. Martin.
- Article: "The SOLID Principles in Real Life" by Dhananjay Kumar on dev.to.
- Official C# documentation: https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/csharp/

## Let's Get Started!

We hope this repository serves as a useful tool to enhance your C# programming skills and your understanding of Clean Code and SOLID design principles!

1. Clone this repository to your local.
2. Create a branch with a descriptive name for your coding exercise. You can create a branch for each topic (Clean Code, SOLID Design Principles, etc.). Do not forguet to add your username to the branch name so we will avoid conflicts due to same branch topic for different people.
3. Work the corresponding coding exercise in your branch, follow the next instructions: 
    1. In the Clean Code project, you have to identify all the bad practices on the code and refactoring the appropiate changes.
    2. In the SOLID Design Principle folder, you will have a project for each principle. Identify bad practices according to the principle you are working on and make the necessary modifications to the code to comply with the good practices of the SOLID principles.
4. When you complete an exercise, please submit a pull request so that we can review your changes and give you any feedback.

Let's embark on your journey to write more solid and clean code at Tiger Connect! Explore the sample code, experiment, and feel free to share your learnings and accomplishments in the repository. Together, we can improve our skills and create higher quality software.

Happy coding! üë®‚Äçüíªüë©‚Äçüíª
