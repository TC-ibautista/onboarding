# Onboarding Practice Project: Clean Code and Best Practices#

Welcome to the onboarding practice repository for Clean Code and best practices! In this project, you will focus on learning and applying fundamental concepts for writing clean code in the context of the programing languages used in the Platform.

## Project Objectives

The main goal of this repository is to enhance your programming skills for C# and Erlang through understanding and applying the following aspects:

1. **Clean Code**: We will learn to write clean and readable code, following the guidelines and recommendations of Robert C. Martin in his book "Clean Code." We will explore techniques and practices to enhance the quality and maintainability of our code.


## Repository Structure

The repository will be organized as follows:


- **`csharp/`**: This folder will contain the source files of our C# project. We will implement examples and exercises related to Clean Code and SOLID design principles here, you can find the details in the README file inside the folder.
  

- **`erlang/`**: This folder will contain the source files of our Erlang project. We will implement examples and exercises related to Clean Code and best practices here, you can find the details in the README file inside the folder.
